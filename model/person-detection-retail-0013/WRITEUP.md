The following address an explanation of the process behind converting any custom layers, as well as explaining the potential reasons for handling custom layers in a trained model.

## Explaining Custom Layers in OpenVINOâ„¢

According to [Custom Layers Guide](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_HOWTO_Custom_Layers_Guide.html), we learn that custom layers are layers that are not included in the list of known layers. If your topology contains any layers that are not in the list of known layers, the Model Optimizer classifies them as custom.

Before building the model's internal representation, the Model Optimizer will search the list of known layers for each layer contained in the input model topology, optimizing the model, and then producing the Intermediate Representation files.

The Inference Engine loads the layers from the input model IR files into the specified device plugin, which will search a list of known layer implementations for the device.
